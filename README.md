# Hooks News web application 

This project is a CRUD web application made entirey with React hooks (no class-based components) and Firebase. Creating this app served as a way for me to practice using React hooks, as well as learn about Firebase, as this was my first time ever working with Google's cloud database. 

The styling for this app was kept very basic, as my main motivation for the project was much more focused on the technologies of react hooks and firebase than styling.
